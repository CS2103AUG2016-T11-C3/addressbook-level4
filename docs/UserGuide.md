## 1. Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever felt like there are too many tasks to do, and you are unable to remember all of them? Or feel that your calendar is overflowing with sticky notes on the tasks to be done each day? Have no fear, as our all-in-one task management application, sTask, is here to save your day!

sTask manages the different types of tasks that you will encounter in your daily life, be it a deadline for submission, or even a date with your significant other, this application can show you what all the tasks you have in a month in one glance, or even a list of tasks for a specific day. sTask also manages your list of ad-hoc tasks, which are non-dated tasks such as "Read the new Harry Potter book!", and displays them beautifully and neatly at the side of the application, so you can refer to them any time you have some free time.

Love typing? You will love sTask, as you only need to use the keyboard to type simple commands to manage your tasks.
