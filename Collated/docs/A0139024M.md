&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3.5 Model component</b>

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramTD.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/stask/model/Model.java)

Based on Figure BLAH above, the `Model`,
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores sTask data
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3.6 Storage component</b>

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramTD.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/stask/storage/Storage.java)

As you can see, the `Storage` component can save and read `UserPref` objects in json format as well as sTask data in xml format.

## 4. Implementation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4.1 Logging</b>

We are using `java.util.logging.Logger` as our logger, and `LogsCenter` is used to manage the logging levels 
of loggers and handlers (for output of log messages)

    - You can control the logging level by using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file 
      (See [Configuration](#3-2-configuration))
    - You can also obtain the `Logger` for a class by using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which logs messages according
      to the specified logging level
    - You can see the current log messages through: `Console` and `.log`

**Logging Levels**

There are several different logging levels based on the severity that you have to take note of when developing sTask.

* SEVERE 
 
    The critical use case is affected, and this may possibly cause the termination of sTask

* WARNING

    sTask can continue to run, but you have to take caution

* INFO

    This logs information that is important for sTask's purpose e.g. updating to the local model or sending a request to cloud
    This logging level provides information that the layman user can understand

* FINE

    Logs of this level are used for superficial debugging purposes to pinpoint components that the fault/bug is likely to arise from
    They should include more detailed information as compared to `INFO`, e.g. printing the actual list of tasks instead of just its size


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4.2 Configuration</b>

You can control certain properties of sTask (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`)
