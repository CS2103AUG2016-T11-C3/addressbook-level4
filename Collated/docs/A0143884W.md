## 1. Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello new developers! We are pleased to welcome you into our team and we hope that you will enjoy your time working with us. sTask is a reliable task management application that accepts 3 kinds of tasks, namely: floating tasks, deadlines and events. This application caters to users who prefer using the command-line interface. Our Developer Guide introduces you to our code base so that you can dive straight into code without much lead-time. The documents listed provide details about how to extend our application using Java's various APIs. 

Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away
-Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## 2. Setting up

Before you start to delve into the development of sTask, please ensure that you have set up the project correctly by following the procedures outlined below. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2.1 Prerequisites</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.1.1</b> First, ensure that you have **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

      Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
      This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.1.2</b> Next, install **Eclipse** IDE on your working computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.1.3</b> Subsequently, install the **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Start from step 2 onwards given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious)) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.1.4</b> Finally, grab the **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2.2 Importing the project into Eclipse</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.2.1</b> Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.2.2</b> Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.2.3</b> Click `File` > `Import` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.2.4</b> Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.2.5</b> Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2.2.6</b> Click `Finish` <br>

      If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
      Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
      If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## 3. Design

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="800"><br><br>

>For you to get a better understanding of sTask's design architecture, we have compiled it into a diagram as seen above in Figure 1. This **Architecture Diagram** explains the high-level design of sTask, and we will proceed to guide you through each of the components. <br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3.1 Main Component</b>
 
 In the `Main` component, you can only find one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/stask/MainApp.java). During the launch of sTask, MainApp initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connects them to each other. MainApp is also responsible for shutting down the componenets and invoking clean up methods when sTask is exited.<br><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3.2 Common Component</b>

In this component, you can find a collection of classes that are used by several of the other components. 

Two of these classes play an important role at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many other classes to write log messages to sTask's log files.
* Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.stask.commons` package. 

The rest of sTask consists of four components:
* [**`UI`**](3-3-ui-component), which is in charge of the User Interface of sTask.
* [**`Logic`**](3-4-logic-component), which is in charge of executing the logic.
* [**`Model`**](3-5-model-component), which holds the data of sTask in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](3-6storage-component), which reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of these four components defines its _API_ as an interface with the same name as the Component. `Logic.java`
Its functionality is also exposed using a `{Component Name}Manager` class e.g. `LogicManager.java`

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete A3`.

<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800">

>You can see how the `Model` simply raises a `ModelChangedEvent` when the model is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br><br>
<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800">

> You should take note of how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps to reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

We will now go into further details about each component.

## 5. Testing

In this section, we will elaborate more about the test suite that we have used during development.

**In Eclipse**: 
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), please ensure that you enable assertions in 
  JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose 
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose 
  to run as a JUnit test.
  
**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle. 

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

> **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.  
       
> **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include: <br>

    1 Unit tests targeting the lowest level methods/classes. e.g. `seedu.stask.commons.UrlUtilTest`
    2 Integration tests that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). e.g. `seedu.stask.storage.StorageManagerTest`
    3 Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as  how the are connected together. e.g. `seedu.stask.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the ([TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX)) library we use,
 you can run the GUI tests in the _headless_ mode. 
 In this mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means that you can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br> <br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
