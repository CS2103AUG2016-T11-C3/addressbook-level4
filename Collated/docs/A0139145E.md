&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3.4 Logic component</b>

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="600"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/stask/logic/Logic.java)

In this component, you can see from Figure BLAH that,

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
